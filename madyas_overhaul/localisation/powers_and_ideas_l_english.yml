 mas_hinalliwood:0 "Hinilawod"
 mas_hinalliwood_desc:0 "Since time immemorial our people has kept the 29 000 verse-epic of Hinilawod alive. It tells the story of the great adventurers and gods of our people and teaches generation upon generation the value of family, honor, dignity and bravery. This way our legacy is carried onwards even as we integrate the customs and stories of foreign peoples into our own."
 mas_legacy_of_panai:0 "Legacy of Panai"
 mas_legacy_of_panai_desc:0 "In the age of Srivijaya our people ruled the constituent kingdom of Panai on faraway Sumatra. For centuries they fought to keep the Srivijayan waters free of hostile ships and pirates. Eventually, as the empire fell to foreign invaders, our ancestors refused to bend their heads to these new rulers and instead migrated to the islands we now occupy. The traditions of our people still make us excellent sailors and fiercely independent warriors."
 mas_articles_of_the_confederation:0 "Articles of the Confederation"
 mas_articles_of_the_confederation_desc:0 "Our state, the Madyas, is a confederation of sovereign territories ruled by the commander in chief chosen through election among all peoples. This way we always have a leader for our common defense and we can keep the political center relevant to the politics of our people."
 mas_masters_of_maritime_warfare:0 "Masters of Maritime Warfare"
 mas_masters_of_maritime_warfare_desc:0 "Our strong maritime legacy has made our state feared on the open seas. In order to keep our trade safe from those that would steal our wealth we must be put constant pressure on foreign fleets, be they Muslims, Chinese, or from one of the many Indianized kingdoms. Some would call this piracy, but it is their fault for not properly protecting their own."
 mas_moluccan_expansion:0 "The Moluccan Expansion"
 mas_moluccan_expansion_desc:0 "Throughout the ages our people have never ventured into the Moluccas. Now, in order to maintain our trade and raid fleets safe and secure, we need to create new docking ports among the islands."
 mas_riches_of_the_visayas:0 "Riches of the Visayas"
 mas_riches_of_the_visayas_desc:0 "The Visayan islands are famously fertile. Even if not all of them are home to great cities, the rice and meat produced here feeds settlements as far away as Manila and Tondo. Such resources are a great strength for a growing empire such as ours. By providing support and protection from maritime raiders we can support the growth of all our domains."
 mas_expand_the_shipbuilding_sector:0 "Expand the Shipbuilding Sector"
 mas_expand_the_shipbuilding_sector_desc:0 "For trade, fishing and warfare, ships have been an integral part of the Madja-as people for as long as these islands have been settled. The knowledge and experience we have in shipbuilding is unparalleled among our neighbors and as we modernize our navies we should build upon these traditions. Let us pick prominent shipbuilders to study the shipbuilding in the many ports we dock and integrate the best they have to offer in our own projects."
